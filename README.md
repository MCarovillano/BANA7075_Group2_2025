This project implements a **predictive maintenance machine learning system** using **KNIME** to reduce unplanned equipment downtime in manufacturing environments. By leveraging sensor and operational data, the system predicts potential machine failures before they occur, helping shift maintenance strategies from reactive to proactive.

## Objective

- Predict failures of industrial equipment using real-time sensor and historical maintenance data.
- Help maintenance teams schedule repairs more efficiently.
- Reduce unplanned downtime, maintenance costs, and production losses.

##  Machine Learning Approach

We use supervised classification techniques, with a focus on:

- **Random Forests** for robustness and interpretability.
- **Gradient Boosted Trees** for high predictive performance.
- other models as needed

KNIME is used to create the end-to-end workflow for:

- Data ingestion & validation  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Visualization & alerting

##  Tools & Technologies

- **KNIME Analytics Platform**
- **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset**
- Additional datasets:
  - Industrial Equipment Monitoring
  - Machine Failure Prediction using Sensor Data
- **DataOps Tools**: Automated pipelines, validation checks, and data versioning
